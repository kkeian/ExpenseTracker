# Expense Tracker
This repo is a small application I use to learn new programming languages.  
  
I translate this program into the syntax of the language I'm learning at the time, to get comfortable with the basics of the language.

## Usage - if you want to actually use this
```
python3 main.py
```
The UI displays on the command line. Just follow the prompts.  
Not meant to be especially useful, so don't expect much.  
If you want to make it relatively useful you'll want to add some features.  

### Ideas for Improvements
- Make it into a script
- Allow changing the output file
- Allow adding onto an existing file
- Handle different OS newline conventions
- Create actions menu for startup
